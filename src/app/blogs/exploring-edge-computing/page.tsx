                  Understanding Edge Computing
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Edge computing represents a decentralized computing
                  infrastructure where data processing is performed closer to
                  the data source, typically at the "edge" of the network,
                  rather than relying solely on centralized data centers or
                  cloud services. This approach minimizes latency, enhances
                  real-time data processing capabilities, and reduces the burden
                  on network bandwidth.
                </p>

                <p>
                  At its core, edge computing leverages distributed computing
                  resources, including edge devices, routers, gateways, and
                  servers, to enable faster response times and improved
                  scalability for applications that require low latency and high
                  availability. By bringing computation and data storage closer
                  to the point of data generation, edge computing enables more
                  efficient, responsive, and secure data processing workflows.
