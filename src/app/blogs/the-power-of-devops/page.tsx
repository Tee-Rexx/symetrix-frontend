                  Understanding DevOps
                </h2>
                <p>
                  DevOps is a cultural and technical movement that emphasizes
                  collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement across
                  the software development lifecycle (SDLC). By breaking down
                  silos between development and operations teams, DevOps aims to
                  streamline processes, accelerate delivery, and enhance the
                  quality of software deployments.
                </p>

                <p>
                  At its core, DevOps embodies the following key principles:
                </p>

                <br />
                <p>
                  <b>. Collaboration:</b> Encouraging cross-functional
                  collaboration and communication between development,
                  operations, and other stakeholders to foster shared ownership
                  and accountability.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>. Automation:</b> Leveraging automation tools and practices
                  to automate repetitive tasks, streamline workflows, and ensure
