        <p className="text-center text-gray-700 px-4 lg:mx-24 mb-4">
          Now more than ever, in a highly digital era, the onus falls on
          creating websites that look amazing but perform well. Here at Naxiums,
          we could not be proud to proclaim an exciting new partnership that
          will pursue value, innovation, and higher customer satisfaction: our
          new partnership with Blacksmith Agency. Its objective will be to

          Why Data-Driven Design Matters ?
        </h2>

        <p className="text-center text-gray-700 px-4 lg:mx-24 mb-4">
          On the other hand, the data-driven web design relies so much on
          analytics and actionable insights into users behaviors but with a
          series of accountable performance indicators at the inception of all
          decisions. Focusing on real-world concrete data, the business shall
          introduce websites capable of increasing not just user engagement but
          conversion rates for businesses. Implementing data-driven
          transformations on a business website, within three months, the
          user-engaging ratio increased by 35 %. In their purest form, this is
          how designs have to be able to affect not only the inspiration point
          of users but also the attainment of critical business objectives.
