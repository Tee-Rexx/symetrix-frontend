      question: 'How do you handle communication and project updates?',
      answer: `Effective communication is vital for the success of any project. We assign a dedicated project manager to each
              client, who serves as the primary point of contact. We hold regular meetings and provide progress reports to keep you
              informed about the project's status. We also use project management tools that allow you to track progress in
              real-time.`
